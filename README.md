# Task-Manager

This project was designed to help university students organize themselves in their studies and daily tasks with 3 functions, namely:

<h2>Task Manager</h2>
The task manager can be used to organize tasks, edit and delete them whenever you want.

<h2>Timer</h2>
The timer can be used to set a time for a task when it is being performed or in any other way that the user wants to use it. In it we implemented the function to pause it and reset it.

<h2>Pomodoro</h2>
The pomodoro is a study method based on time organization, with 25 minutes focusing on your task and 5 minutes for a break and rest. In it we implemented the pause function in case the user has something unforeseen during the study and does not want their time to continue counting and the reset function so that if the user starts another task they can restart it.
